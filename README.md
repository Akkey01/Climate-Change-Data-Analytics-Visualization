### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data/

## Features
1. Regression
    - Temperature prediction and visualization for a specific country, city, month and years using Linear Regression.
    - Temperature prediction for a specific year using multiple regression techniques like
      1. Linear regression
      2. Isotonic regression
      3. Bayesian Ridge
      4. RANSAC
      5. Gaussian Process
      6. SVR
2. Clustering
    - Classified earth surface temerature into 3 clusters of hot, mild and cold.
    - Generated a google map with showing the clusters for a specific year.
    - Model can predict temperature class of any given latitude and longitude for any year and month.
3. Visualization
    - Earth surface mean temperature rise curve from year 1750.
    - Divided a year in 4 seasons and visualized the average temperature of major cities in India.
    - Visualized earth surface average temperature using world map.
